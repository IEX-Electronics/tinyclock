# tinyclock

## What is this?
This tinyclock was designed to be placed on top of my Bambu Lab H2S using power from the USB port. (Yes, I know, it's janky), but since my room doesn't have a clock or other
timekeeping mechanism, and the printer doesn't have one, I thought it would be pretty nifty to have a little no-controls 4-segment display clock (using bluetooth/wifi for initial setup)
to connect to the internet to NTP servers such as time.apple.com, which automatically set date/time based on IP. (No need to reset for daylight savings time). Originally, I also intended
to make a USB to dual USB adapter, but I ran out of budget for tier 4 (the tier for HACKCLUB). 

## Concept Sketches

PCB with resistors added. I don't have any 3D model for seeed studio rp2040 nor the 7-segment display, but this is how it should look, (roughly)
